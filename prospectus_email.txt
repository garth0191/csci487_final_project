My senior project will further develop an initial idea implemented last semester in my CSCI 387 course. That project
involved creating a simple application to hold uploaded student notes, and its functionality was limited to user
authentication, course management, and note feedback. For this project, I would like to expand on that idea to create 
an application/website that acts as a course management tool as well as a fully functioning gradebook for instructors.
Functionality would encompass user authentication (for instructors, assistants, students, and administrators), course 
creation and management, assignment and grade management, and (if time allows) a means of communicating directly with 
students via the application.
